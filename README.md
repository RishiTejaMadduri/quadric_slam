# Quadric SLAM #

## Attention: This project is under construction, so it may NOT work well. Contact us freely if you have questions.

This code contains a basic implementation for Cube SLAM. Given RGB and 2D object detection, the algorithm detects 3D cuboids from each frame then formulate an object SLAM to optimize both camera pose and cuboid poses. ```object_slam``` is main package. ```detect_3d_cuboid``` is the C++ version of single image cuboid detection, corresponding to a [matlab version](https://github.com/shichaoy/matlab_cuboid_detect).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
This code contains several ros packages. We test it in **ROS indigo/kinetic/Melodic, Ubuntu 14.04/16.04/18.04, Opencv 2/3**. Create or use existing a ros workspace.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/cubeslam_ws/src
cd ~/cubeslam_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
git clone git@github.com:shichaoy/cube_slam.git
cd cube_slam
```

### Compile dependency g2o
```bash
sh install_dependenices.sh
```

### Compile
```bash
cd ~/cubeslam_ws
catkin_make -j4
```

## Running #
```bash
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch object_slam object_slam_example.launch
```
You will see results in Rviz. Default rviz file is for ros indigo. A kinetic version is also provided.
